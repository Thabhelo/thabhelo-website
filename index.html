        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a highly motivated and driven individual, with some valuable experience through a variety of internships and programs. My most recent position as a Teaching Assistant (TA) at <a href="https://www.emziniwecode.com/cs7" target="_blank">Emzini We Code</a> has allowed me to expand, not only my knowledge and understanding of programming but my network as well. It has given me a glance at college life as a computer science student and exposed me to an opportunity to show some level of aptitude and ability to teach.

        My previous position as a data analysis clerk at <a href="https://www.telone.co.zw/" target="_blank">TelOne</a> allowed me to hone my skills in data management and analysis, while also fostering a strong attention to detail and a commitment to accuracy. This exposed me to a platform where I exercised my digital and financial literacy skills, use of technologies like Microsoft Excel, and several other interiorly used technologies. 

        In addition to my professional experience, I have also had the opportunity to explore my passions through travel and education. Through the <a href="https://exchanges.state.gov/non-us/program/english-access-microscholarship-program" target="_blank">English Access Microscholarship Program</a>, I had the chance to travel the world and immerse myself in new cultures, which helped me develop a global perspective and a deep appreciation for diversity. I have had an opportunity to meet great and awesome people, an opportunity that has shaped me and proved beneficial for a long time. 

        Looking ahead, I am excited to continue my academic journey as a college student, where I am eager to further develop my skills and pursue new opportunities. With a strong work ethic, a passion for learning, and a commitment to excellence, I am confident that I will make a valuable contribution to any organization or team that I join.

I highlight the sense of community, rich cultural traditions, and resilience of its people, despite economic struggles affecting infrastructure and job opportunities. I appreciate how growing up in Bulawayo has shaped my values of community and resilience, and why the city will always hold a special place in my heart.</li>

It was a grueling 23-kilometer run, but with the support of my teammates, I managed to complete it in 2 hours and 15 minutes. I talk about the many challenges I faced during the months of training leading up to the marathon, including the need for discipline and mental fortitude. I also discuss the importance of community and teamwork among fellow runners, and how this camaraderie helped me to achieve my goal. Overall, the experience left me with a newfound appreciation for the power of marathons as not just physical tests of endurance, but also as opportunities for personal growth and community building. Looking ahead to future marathons, I am excited to continue pushing myself to new heights of endurance and growth.</li>
            <li class="block-text"><a href="https://medium.com/@thabheloduve/a-nasty-gap-year-vacation-plans-gone-too-wrong-924f2fe4ba31"> A nasty gap year vacation: Plans gone too wrong </a> - In this article, I reflect on my gap year experience in Durban, South Africa, which didn't go as planned. I had hoped to spend my days exploring the city and enjoying the beach, but instead, I found myself struggling with loneliness and depression. I turned to music and exercise as forms of therapy, discovering the healing power of Amapiano music and the gym. However, my attempts to make money to sustain myself led me to a toxic work environment, causing further stress and anxiety. It wasn't until I met a swimming tutor, Ursula that I began to see the kindness of strangers and the power of human connection. Through my struggles, I learned valuable lessons about resilience and appreciation for the little things in life. Despite the challenges, I look back on my time in Durban with gratitude and a newfound sense of strength and hope.</li>

Here is why: </a> - In this article, I emphasize the importance of kindness and how it can make a significant difference in the world. I provide four reasons why we should all strive to be kind, including how it improves relationships, increases happiness, creates a ripple effect, and makes the world a better place. I also share an example of how an act of kindness can turn a negative situation into a positive one and create a sense of connection and understanding between two strangers. I discuss the importance of being kind to animals and how they deserve to be treated with respect and compassion. I emphasize that being kind to humans is also crucial and can brighten someone's day and inspire positive change in society. I encourage readers to be kind, as it not only benefits others but also contributes to our own happiness and well-being. In my future writings, I plan to explore the correlation between kindness and financial stability and share insights on how kindness can bring hope and positivity into our lives. Let's all strive to be the reason why someone's day is filled with hope and spread kindness wherever we go. ‚ù§Ô∏èüëç</li>
